It demonstrates how to deploy [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie), an SSH honeypot, in a Dockerized lab environment.

- Do **not** deploy this honeypot in production environments or networks that handle sensitive data.
- Honeypots are designed to attract attackers — running one may increase unwanted traffic to your system.

- Report them upstream to the [Cowrie project](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie).

## Legal & Ethical Considerations
- Logs may contain IP addresses, usernames, or other identifying data from external systems.
